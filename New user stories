As a user :

[Project #show]
For each project:
- I can see all the tracks I'm working on, with whom, and see which ones are done.
- I can add a new track to a project ; when adding a new track, I can assign other users (with a corresponding skill) to it, upload a basic track available to all assigned users, and send a brief for the track.

[Track #show]
For each track:
- I can see all the ongoing collaborative sessions, all the track infos, and have access to the completed sessions files.

  For each session:
  - I can listen to all the versions uploaded by the collaborator via an audio player.
  - I can comment in real-time on the audio, and see the comments timeline on the player.
  - I can display a chronology of all the comments made on a given session.
  - I can decide when a session is completed ; when it is, I can send a final request to the collaborator for him to send the isolated audio track, which will become available in the Files section (call to action => modal).
